# linux-config

## what is this ðŸ¤”

This repo includes all my personal configurations, shortcuts, functions, aliases, and environment variables I wish to keep and reuse forever. This repo's **purpose** is to make it convenient to relocate my settings on any computer/OS I may use in the future.

## instructions ðŸ“œ

These instructions are aimed at myself, ignore.

Remaining instructions:
- [ ] import keys
- [x] install *gh*
- [x] run ```gh auth login```, follow prompts
- [x] clone *pass*
- [x] clone *linux-config*
- [ ] clone *scripts*
- [ ] clone *tasks*
- [ ] clone *bills*
- [ ] clone *journal*
- [ ] clone *archives*
- [ ] clone *data*
- [ ] clone *resume*
- [ ] mv *pass* to *.password-store*
- [ ] mv *linux-config* to *config* 
- [ ] Symlink <u>.bashrc</u> to */config/bashrc

My personal bashrc will, in this order:

1. Load all my variables
2. Load all my aliases
3. Load all my functions
4. Load the prompt
5. Run the startup script
