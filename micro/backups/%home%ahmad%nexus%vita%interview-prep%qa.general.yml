    - Q: Tell us about yourself.
      A: >
        From an early age, I developed a curiosity for hidden mechanisms of the world and a deep passion for numbers.
        I would do lots of arithmetic for fun.
        That's why in high-school I chose courses that are more science heavy. I was top of the class in mathematics in the last two years of high-school, it was my favorite subject.
        Then I took Natural Science in college, then Physics-Mathematics in University, before I had a change of heart and decided to study computer science in the last year of uni. I was very into video games at the time, and I was dreaming of creating my own from scratch.
        Now I'm 100% invested in software development in Algonquin College, and I'm hoping that this job I'm interviewing for is the very first step I take in the IT field.
        As for professions, I've worked in few places, and I am currently enrolled in the Canadian Armed Forces.

        My passion for video games began in 2002 at age four, playing Nintendo 64—a
  spark that grew into a lifelong obsession with systems and problem-solving. In 
  high school, I discovered a gift for math and science, where solving equations 
  felt like cracking puzzles. I pursued Physics and Mathematics at the University
  of Ottawa, diving into calculus and quantum mechanics, but realized I craved 
  creation over theory. Coding reignited the excitement I felt playing games as a
  child, so I pivoted to software engineering at Algonquin College.

          My journey includes three purposeful years in the Canadian Armed Forces: 
  operating combat vehicles as an armoured crewman and managing payroll databases
  as an HR Clerk. These roles taught me discipline under pressure and precision 
  with complex systems—skills I now apply to coding practical solutions like a 
  Java-based Food Waste Reduction Platform and automating workflows with 50+ Bash
  scripts.

    - Q: Can you tell us about a time when you demonstrated self-motivation in a work or academic setting?
      A: >
        Back in Uni, after a shameful failure in my first assignment in Java, I decided to use the break week to relearn Java from the very beginning while documenting my learning every step of the way. I watched hours of YouTube tutorials, and I made a Leetcode account in order to practice my skills. I got an A+ on the second assignment after that.

    - Q: How do you prioritize your tasks and manage your time effectively to ensure project deadlines are met?
      A: >
        - Assess project requirements and deadlines.
        - Break down tasks into manageable chunks.
        - Set priorities based on urgency, importance, and dependencies.
        - Create a schedule with specific time slots for each task.
        - Monitor progress regularly against the planned schedule.
        - Set plan B, and more in case of unexpected events.
        - Maintain open communication and collaboration with team members.
        - Finally, sort by urgency

    - Q: Describe a situation where you had to work as part of a team to achieve a common goal. How did you contribute to the team's success?
      A: >
        In our first few days of basic military training, we failed the morning inspection all the time. We've suffered a lot as a consequence. I suggested an idea to our team, which they thought was good. I offered to personally gather all the cleaning supplies which weren't provided such as dusters, microfibers, and vacuums, to help achieve our goal. We all pitched in some money together, and I went to gather the supplies before our next inspection.

    - Q: Can you provide an example of a time when you encountered a problem while working on a project and how you went about identifying and resolving it?
      A: >
        I encountered an issue with a mysterious infinite loop in my code, caused by a scanner. When a user would put a bad input, the code would loop to infinity, and no one I asked could figure out why. So I did what I was trying to avoid doing, which is going to the official documentation and read the entire thing. I was able to figure out my problem which had to do with how the Scanner class does not consume a token when hasNextDouble is called...
        Variable keyboard has no tokens. So hasNextDouble will force the user to enter one. Assume the token is bad this time keyboard has a token from earlier. hasNextDouble() will check if the token is a double, but it will NOT consume it. So you're stuck with the same token! And the token is bad. It loops back to check if the same token is a double ad infinitum.

    - Q: Tell us about a time when you had to adapt to changes in a project or work environment. How did you handle the situation and maintain productivity?
      A: >
        During a previous project, we encountered unexpected changes in project requirements and scope. To adapt, I quickly assessed the new situation, prioritized tasks accordingly, and communicated effectively with team members. I remained flexible, adjusted timelines and resources as needed, and focused on maintaining open collaboration and a positive mindset. By staying organized, seeking support when necessary, and embracing the changes, I was able to navigate the situation successfully while maintaining productivity.

    - Q: Attention to detail is crucial in programming and testing IT solutions. Can you provide an example of a time when your attention to detail helped you identify a critical issue or error?
      A: >
        Hardcoded divisor for average instead of counter. I encountered a bug that caused incorrect calculation results. By paying attention to detail, I discovered the omission of a counter variable in the loop structure, which affected the accuracy of the calculations. Adding the counter variable resolved the issue, highlighting the importance of careful code review and validating assumptions.

    - Q: The CRA emphasizes work-life balance. How do you maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life? Can you provide an example of how this has positively impacted your performance?
      A: >
        I maintain a healthy work-life balance by setting clear boundaries and adhering to a structured routine. For example, I allocate specific hours for work and personal activities, ensuring I have time for relaxation and hobbies. This approach has positively impacted my performance by reducing burnout and keeping me energized and focused during work hours.

    - Q: The ITB division at the CRA works on exciting projects to enhance skills and competencies. Can you share an example of a project you have worked on that challenged you and helped you grow professionally?
      A: >
        One project that challenged me was developing a bank account management system. It required me to implement complex logic for handling transactions, balances, and user interactions. This project helped me grow professionally by improving my problem-solving skills, deepening my understanding of software design principles, and enhancing my ability to work under tight deadlines.

    - Q: The CRA emphasizes diversity in its workforce. How do you contribute to creating an inclusive and collaborative work environment?
      A: >
        I contribute to an inclusive and collaborative work environment by actively listening to diverse perspectives, encouraging open communication, and respecting everyone's unique contributions. I also participate in team-building activities and advocate for equitable opportunities, ensuring that all team members feel valued and supported.

    - Q: Describe a time when you received feedback on your work. How did you handle constructive criticism, and how did it impact your future performance?
      A: >
        During a team project, I received feedback that my code documentation could be more detailed. I took this constructive criticism positively and immediately worked on improving my documentation practices. This not only enhanced the quality of my work but also improved team collaboration, as my colleagues could better understand and build upon my contributions.

    - Q: Problem-solving is an essential skill in IT roles. Can you walk us through your approach to solving complex problems, especially when faced with limited resources or time constraints?
      A: >
        My approach to solving complex problems involves breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts, prioritizing tasks based on impact, and leveraging available resources efficiently. For example, when faced with a critical bug close to a deadline, I focused on identifying the root cause, implementing a temporary fix to meet the deadline, and then refining the solution post-release.

    - Q: What are your strengths and weaknesses?
      A: >
        Strengths:
        "One of my strengths lies in my strong logical reasoning skills, which have been honed through my STEM background and studies in physics-mathematics. This foundation has equipped me with the ability to analyze complex problems, identify patterns, and think critically. I find enjoyment in applying logical thinking to find innovative solutions and overcome challenges. Furthermore, my proficiency in mathematics allows me to approach problems with a quantitative mindset, enabling me to make data-driven decisions and contribute to efficient problem-solving."
        
        Weaknesses:
        "While I take pride in my attention to detail, I am aware that at times, I may become overly focused on minor imperfections. This intense attention to detail can occasionally cause me to lose sight of the bigger picture. However, I have actively worked on mitigating this tendency by setting clear priorities and regularly stepping back to gain a broader perspective. For instance, during a recent project, I caught myself getting caught up in minute details, but I quickly recognized this and took a step back to reassess the overall project goals and objectives. This allowed me to regain focus and align my efforts with the larger picture, ensuring that my attention to detail was channeled effectively."

    - Q: Can you provide an example of solving a conflict or handling a difference in opinion?
      A: >
        In a team setting, I once encountered a conflict where two team members had differing opinions on the implementation approach for a feature. I facilitated a discussion where both parties could present their viewpoints, and we collaboratively evaluated the pros and cons of each approach. By focusing on the shared goal and finding a compromise, we resolved the conflict and moved forward with a solution that incorporated the best aspects of both ideas.
