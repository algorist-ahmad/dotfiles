  # QUESTIONS TO INTERVIEWEE
      
    interviewee:
      - Q: Can you describe your experience with Java web services and how you have used them in backend development?
        A: >
          For my final project at Algonquin, I built a Food Waste Reduction Platform to connect food
          retailers, consumers, and charities. The goal was to reduce food waste by helping retailers
          donate or sell surplus food at a discount. Retailers could list food items close to expiration,
          and consumers or charities could claim them.
          
          I used Java for the backend, focusing on a simple three-tier setup: a UI layer, a business
          logic layer, and a MySQL database. I created features like user registration, inventory management,
          and notifications for surplus items based on user preferences.
          
          I also made sure the system could update inventories when food was donated or sold. And to
          keep everything running smoothly, I wrote JUnit tests for key features like inventory updates and notifications.
          
          It was a great hands-on experience with backend development and database management.
          (JUNIT tests are missing from github though, if caught just say something like forgot to push...)
          
      - Q: How do you approach unit and integration testing in your development process? Can you provide an example of a testing framework you have used?
        A: >
          I think testing is super important, so I always make sure to write unit and integration tests to catch bugs early and make sure things work as expected. I’ve mostly used JUnit for unit testing—it's something I'm comfortable with.
          
          For example, in one of my projects, I wrote unit tests to check that the inventory update system worked correctly when food was donated or purchased. I also did some basic integration tests to make sure the whole process—from user registration to updating the database—ran smoothly.
          
          I believe in testing early and often to catch issues before they become bigger problems, and JUnit has been a solid tool for that.
          
          For integration testing, I focus on how different parts of the system work together. In the same project, I tested how the backend interacted with the database to make sure data was being saved and retrieved correctly. I didn’t use a specific framework for integration testing, but I manually tested key workflows, like user registration and inventory updates, to ensure everything connected smoothly.
          
          I’m always looking to improve my testing skills, and I’m open to learning more advanced tools and frameworks in the future.
          
      - Q: The job description mentions working in an agile environment. Can you describe your experience with agile methodologies, such as Scrum?
        A: >
          My experience with agile methodologies, especially Scrum, comes from a group project where we enhanced a website connecting employers to gig workers for a real client. We used Scrum to manage the project, and it was a great way to stay organized and collaborative.
          
          We started by breaking down the project into smaller tasks, like improving the user interface, adding new features, and fixing bugs. Each task was created as an issue in Zenhub, and we assigned them to team members based on their strengths. We worked in two-week sprints, which helped us focus on delivering specific improvements incrementally.
          
          During the project, we held daily stand-ups to discuss progress, any blockers, and what we planned to work on next. At the end of each sprint, we had a sprint review to demonstrate the completed work to our client and a retrospective to reflect on what went well and what we could improve. This iterative approach allowed us to adapt quickly to feedback and ensure the client was happy with the progress.
          
          Using Zenhub for task management and tracking progress was really helpful. It gave us a clear overview of who was working on what and helped us stay on top of deadlines. This experience gave me a solid understanding of how Scrum works in practice, and I’m confident I can apply these skills in a professional environment like Thales.

      - Q: What is your experience with containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes?
        A: >
        I don’t have hands-on experience with Docker or Kubernetes yet, but I understand the concept and why they’re so important. From what I’ve learned, containerization is like shipping the computer itself along with the software—it packages the application, its dependencies, and everything it needs to run, ensuring consistency across different environments. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem and makes deployments much smoother.
        
        As a matter of fact, after my call with Mr. Paul, I went straight to register for a course on Udemy to start learning Docker and Kubernetes. I’m really eager to dive into these tools because I see how critical they are for modern backend development, especially for scaling applications and managing deployments efficiently. I’m a quick learner, and I’ve successfully picked up new technologies before, like when I taught myself Bash scripting to automate repetitive tasks. I’d be excited to apply these skills in a professional setting at Thales.

      - Q: Can you describe a time when you identified and fixed a critical software defect? What was your process?
        A: >
        I once encountered a tricky issue with an infinite loop in my code caused by a Scanner object. The problem occurred when a user entered invalid input—instead of prompting the user to try again, the program would get stuck in an infinite loop. At first, I couldn’t figure out why, and even my peers were stumped. So, I decided to dig deeper and went straight to the official Java documentation to understand how the Scanner class works.
        
        After reading through the documentation, I discovered that the issue was related to how the hasNextDouble() method behaves. When the user enters invalid input, the method checks if the input is a double but doesn’t consume the token if it’s invalid. This meant the same invalid token was being checked repeatedly, causing the infinite loop. To fix it, I added a next() call to consume the invalid token, which allowed the program to prompt the user for new input and resolve the issue.
        
        This experience taught me the importance of thoroughly understanding the tools and libraries I’m using, and it reinforced the value of consulting official documentation when debugging complex issues. I actually apply this principle in real life too—for example, when I bought a new car, the first thing I did was read the entire manual to understand its software and maintenance requirements. It’s just how I approach learning and problem-solving, whether it’s in code or everyday life.

      - Q: How do you stay current with software development best practices and methodologies?
        A: >
          I stay current with software development best practices and methodologies by following tech news and communities. For example, I regularly watch Fireship on YouTube, which provides quick and insightful updates on major trends in the tech field. I also occasionally browse Reddit to see what’s being discussed in developer communities. This helps me stay informed about new tools, frameworks, and best practices without getting overwhelmed.
        
      - Q: The role involves working with military or aerospace domains. Do you have any experience in these areas, and how do you think it will help you in this role?
        A: >
          While I don’t have direct experience in aerospace or military software development, my time in the Canadian Armed Forces has given me valuable skills that I believe are highly relevant to this role. As an Armoured Crewman and Human Resources Clerk, I worked in environments where precision, teamwork, and reliability were essential. For example, in my HR role, I managed payroll and personnel data using Oracle database systems, ensuring everything was accurate and compliant with military standards. This experience taught me the importance of attention to detail and working efficiently under pressure—skills I’m eager to bring to Thales.
          
          My military training, including Basic Military Qualification (BMQ), also emphasized teamwork and problem-solving in challenging situations. One memorable example was during BMQ, when my team kept failing morning inspections. I suggested we pool resources to buy cleaning supplies like dusters and vacuums, which weren’t provided. Everyone pitched in, and I took the lead in gathering the supplies. This small but practical solution helped us pass inspections and taught me the value of collaboration and creative problem-solving.

      - Q: How do you handle tight deadlines and prioritize tasks in a fast-paced environment?
        A: >
          For tight deadlines, I focus on clear communication and effective prioritization. I break tasks into smaller chunks, prioritize by urgency and importance, and create a schedule. If the workload is too much, I communicate with my supervisor to discuss what’s feasible and explore options like additional resources or adjusted priorities.
          
          For example, during the website project for the gig worker platform, we had a tight deadline to deliver new features. I worked with my team to prioritize critical tasks and used Zenhub to track progress. Regular check-ins with the client ensured we stayed aligned and delivered on time.

      - Q: Can you explain your experience with REST API creation and management?
        A: >
          My experience with REST API creation and management comes primarily from school exercises, where I learned the fundamentals of designing and implementing APIs. For example, during one of my courses, I built a simple RESTful API using Spring Boot to handle basic CRUD operations for a student management system. I designed endpoints for adding, updating, and retrieving student data, and used Postman to test the API’s functionality.
          
          While my experience is academic, I gained a solid understanding of REST principles, such as using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and structuring endpoints logically. I’m eager to expand my experience with REST APIs in a professional setting and apply these foundational skills to real-world projects at Thales.

      - Q: What motivates you to work in software development, and why are you interested in this role at Thales?
        A: >
         I’m passionate about software development because it allows me to create—not just understand the theory, but build real-world solutions that make a difference. Whether it’s automating repetitive tasks with a Bash script or designing a platform to address a specific need, I find it incredibly rewarding to see my work in action.
         
         I’m particularly interested in this role at Thales because it aligns well with my skills and background as a new graduate. I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to innovative projects in the aerospace and defense sectors, where precision and reliability are critical. Additionally, I admire Thales’ commitment to cutting-edge technology and its global impact, and I’m eager to grow my career in such a dynamic and mission-driven environment.

      - Q: "Can you describe your experience with C# and WPF for developing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)?"
        A: > 
          I don’t have direct experience with C\# and WPF yet, but I’m confident in my ability to quickly learn and apply these technologies. My experience with GUI development comes from working on similar frameworks, like JavaFX, during my studies. For example, in one of my projects, I built a desktop application with a responsive and intuitive interface using JavaFX.         
      - Q: How do you approach requirements analysis and software design for front-end applications?
        A: > 
          (forgot to mention use case)
          In the FlexGig project, I approached requirements analysis and software design using an Agile methodology. During the first sprint, we focused on requirement elicitation by collaborating closely with the client to understand their needs. For example, we identified that gig workers needed a more intuitive way to update their availability, so I designed a calendar-based system to address this. I also created wireframes to visualize the interface and iterated based on client feedback.
          
          For software design, I prioritized usability and responsiveness, ensuring the interface worked seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes. I applied the Principle of Least Astonishment to make sure the system behaved in a way that users would naturally expect, minimizing confusion and enhancing the overall user experience. For instance, the calendar feature was designed to mimic familiar calendar applications, so users could interact with it without needing extensive instructions.
          
          I broke down the requirements into smaller, manageable tasks and used modular architecture to make the system easy to update and maintain. Regular bi-weekly meetings with the client allowed us to gather feedback and adjust priorities as needed, ensuring the final design aligned with user expectations and project goals.

      - Q: What is your experience with unit testing and debugging in front-end development?
        A: > 
          In the FlexGig project, my experience with testing and debugging was primarily focused on manual testing due to the team’s limited coordination and the use of PHP and JavaScript for development. While we were able to identify and fix issues, the process was somewhat disorganized, and we didn’t have a structured approach to unit testing.
          
          Looking back, I would now implement a more robust testing strategy using PHP frameworks like PHPUnit for unit testing and JavaScript testing frameworks like Jest for front-end components. For example, I would write unit tests for the calendar-based availability system to ensure it handles edge cases, such as invalid date inputs or overlapping availability slots. I would also use browser developer tools more systematically to debug issues, such as the chat feature’s occasional failure to display new messages, by simulating different network conditions and user interactions.
          
          Additionally, I would advocate for better coordination within the team by introducing test plans and automated testing pipelines to ensure consistent and thorough testing across all components. This approach would not only improve the reliability of the application but also streamline the debugging process, making it easier to identify and resolve issues early in the development cycle.

      - Q: How familiar are you with military C2, C3, or C4ISR systems, and how do you think this will help you in this role?
        A: > 
          While I don’t have direct experience with military C2, C3, or C4ISR systems, my time in the Canadian Armed Forces has given me a strong understanding of the importance of precision, reliability, and security in mission-critical systems. As an Armoured Crewman and Human Resources Clerk, I worked in environments where attention to detail and adherence to strict protocols were essential. For example, managing payroll and personnel data required ensuring accuracy and compliance with military standards, which parallels the need for precision in software development for defense applications.
          
          I’m deeply interested in contributing to solutions that enhance the safety and effectiveness of soldiers, and I’m confident my military background will help me quickly adapt to the specific requirements of this role. My experience has taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and problem-solving in high-stakes environments—skills I believe are directly transferable to developing software for military systems at Thales.

      - Q: Can you describe a time when you identified and fixed a critical software defect in a front-end application?
        A: > 
          In the FlexGig project, I encountered a critical defect where the chat feature would occasionally fail to display new messages. After analyzing the code, I realized the issue was caused by improper handling of asynchronous data updates. Specifically, the front-end wasn’t consistently receiving updates from the server due to a mismatch in how data was being fetched and rendered.
                
                To fix this, I refactored the code to use a more robust event-driven approach, ensuring that the front-end would dynamically update whenever new messages were received. I also added error handling to manage cases where the server was temporarily unavailable. This not only resolved the issue but also improved the overall reliability and responsiveness of the chat feature.
                
                This experience taught me the importance of thorough testing and debugging in delivering a seamless user experience. It also reinforced the value of designing systems with scalability and error resilience in mind.

      - Q: Tell us about yourself.
        A: "From an early age, I’ve been fascinated by how things work and have always loved solving problems, especially with numbers. In high school, I excelled in math and science, which led me to pursue Physics and Mathematics at the University of Ottawa. While I enjoyed the theoretical side, I realized I wanted to create tangible solutions, which is why I pivoted to software development at Algonquin College. Coding reignited the same excitement I felt as a child playing video games, where I dreamed of building my own systems from scratch.
        
        Outside of academics, I’ve spent three years in the Canadian Armed Forces, where I worked as both an Armoured Crewman and an HR Clerk. These roles taught me discipline, precision, and how to thrive under pressure—skills I now apply to software development. For example, I built a Java-based Food Waste Reduction Platform and automated repetitive tasks with over 50 Bash scripts, which significantly improved efficiency.
        
        Now, I’m fully invested in software development and eager to take my first step into the IT field. This role at Thales excites me because it aligns with my passion for creating impactful solutions and working with cutting-edge technology.

            One of my key strengths is my strong logical reasoning and problem-solving skills, which I’ve developed through my STEM background in physics and mathematics. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, identifying patterns, and finding efficient solutions. For example, in my final project at Algonquin, I used these skills to design and implement a Java-based Food Waste Reduction Platform, ensuring the system was both functional and scalable. My quantitative mindset also helps me make data-driven decisions, which I’ve applied in automating workflows with over 50 Bash scripts to improve productivity.

        - Q: weakness
          A: >
            One weakness I’ve identified is that I can sometimes get too focused on minor details, which can slow me down. For instance, during a project, I caught myself spending too much time perfecting a small feature. To address this, I’ve learned to step back regularly, reassess priorities, and focus on the bigger picture. This approach has helped me balance attention to detail with overall project goals, ensuring I deliver high-quality work without losing sight of deadlines.

      - Q: Why should we hire you?
        A: "Firstly because I fit the description quite well as a new grad but also I'm willing to bet
        that any employer would rather have someone who loves what they do and do it not only to pass requirements but also for the love of the game, than someone who is not, which will more often than not do the bare minimum and lack creativity."

      - Q: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
        A: "In five years I want to be in a position where I know my work is valuable and valued, whether that’s a direct progression, for example as an internal employee, of this role or something I don’t even know about yet. My goal is to be somewhere where I'm proud of what I do and contribute."

      - Q: How do you handle pressure or stressful situations?
        A: >
          I handle pressure by staying organized and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps. For example, during my final project at Algonquin, we had a tight deadline to deliver the Food Waste Reduction Platform. I prioritized tasks, communicated regularly with my team, and kept a clear focus on the end goal. I also make sure to take short breaks to clear my mind, which helps me stay calm and focused under pressure.

      - Q: Describe a time when you faced a conflict in a team. How did you resolve it?
        A: >
          During a group project in college, we had a disagreement about how to implement a feature for our website. Some team members wanted to take a more complex approach, while others preferred a simpler solution. To resolve the conflict, I suggested we list the pros and cons of each approach and discuss them as a team. After weighing the options, we agreed on a solution that balanced functionality with feasibility. This experience taught me the importance of open communication and collaboration in resolving conflicts effectively.
